# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.e

### `npm run build` fails to minify

The provided code snippet utilizes the useSprings hook from the @react-spring/three library to orchestrate animations within a three-dimensional (3D) scene in a React application. Let's delve into the properties and functionalities encapsulated within this snippet:

# Imported Properties:

 useSprings are imported from "@react-spring/three". These enable the integration of spring-based animations into the React application, facilitating smooth and dynamic motion effects within the 3D environment.
 
OrbitControls is imported from "@react-three/drei". This component provides interactive orbit controls for the scene's camera, allowing users to navigate and explore the 3D space with ease.

# Definition of Items:

The items array serves as a repository for defining the initial and final positions of the animated elements within the scene. Each element in this array is represented by an object containing properties for initialPosition and finalPosition, specifying the starting and ending coordinates of the respective element's motion.

# Utilization of useSprings:

useSprings is employed to orchestrate the animation transitions of multiple items within the scene.

It accepts two arguments: the number of items to be animated and an array containing configuration objects for each item's animation.

In this instance, the number of items corresponds to the length of the items array, and each configuration object within the array maps to an item's animation, defining its starting and ending positions through the from and to properties, respectively.

# Scene Rendering:

Within the Scene function, the return statement encapsulates the 3D scene components and their respective configurations.

The useSprings hook is invoked to generate animated transitions for the specified items within the scene.

The resulting animated elements, represented by <a.mesh> components, are iteratively rendered based on the calculated animation states.
